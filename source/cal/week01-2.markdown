# Big Picture
We'll get to know each other.

# The Plan

&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;
 :-- | :--: | :--
 **Activity** | **Time** | **Description**
Icebreaker | 20 min | Get to know one-another.
Hand Coding | 30 min | Our first picture.
Prof Yak #1 | 10 min | Highlight one or two things in the syllabus.
Prof Yak #2 | 10 min | What comes next?
&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;

# Icebreaker
We're going to be spending a lot of time working together. So, my theory is that you should take a few minutes to get to know a few of your classmates before we proceed.

*Your community is your number one support network.*

# Hand Coding

Instead of fighting with the computer on day one, we'll do an exercise on paper. Most computer scientists spend time working ideas out on paper and/or the whiteboard before they write code---so that's what we're going to do, too.

# Prof Yak #1

I'm going to highlight one or two things in the syllabus that I think you'll find are different than what you'd expect. Note, though: it's a short, 10-minute yak, so I'll have to be brief. *That's hard to do.*

# Prof Yak #2

Every class should close with 5-10 minutes of "what's next?" You can look on the website to find that out, too, but it's a way to cap the day. This is also a good time to ask questions.
