# Question and Answer
As usual, an opportunity to start the period with questions.

# Practice Exam
This is a practice exam. Think of it as an "active review." When you're done, please do the following:

1. Take the exam next door to Alden 110, and politely ask Pauline if she would please copy your exam.
1. Leave the original in Prof. Jadud's mailbox, and take your copy home.
1. Watch the pencast (posted to the website as of Thursday afternoon) and grade your exam.
1. Make an appointment with Prof. Jadud ([schedule timeslot](http://goo.gl/ICzf4)) or Prof. Roos to discuss any questions that you might have.

Now, you might have a few questions about all of this.

* **Why are we having a practice exam?** <br/> The act of taking the exam reinforces things you know, helps you understand what you don't, and gets you ready for the kinds of questions we'll ask on the midterm.
* **What if I have questions, and can't make your office hours?** <br/> Use Piazza. In fact, I'd like it if you tried to use Piazza regardless---more people benefit from your questions if you use Piazza.
* **Exams make me freak out. What do I do?** <br/> Really. Honestly. They're just a bunch of questions on a dead tree. A *bleached* dead tree, no less. Besides, this is a practice exam, so it shouldn't freak you out at all. And, once you've done it, you'll have a good idea of what's coming on the midterm, so again: no reason to freak out.
* **No, really, you don't get it!?** <br/> That wasn't a question. And, yes, I do.
* **Will we have to write code?** <br/> Probably. However, you've been writing and answering questions about code on the quizzes all term, so this shouldn't be an issue.
* **What about on the computer?** <br/> Possibly. But, you've been doing that, too.
* **Did students really ask all these questions?** <br/> No. But, I heard some of you talking about the class in GFC the other day, and we have microphones in all the common areas on campus. We know what you're talking about.
