# Pong History

The game of Pong ([online game](http://zinid.com/jspong/), [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong)) has captivated billions, and it has served as the inspiration for every single video game ever invented, even if the game ends up looking nothing like pong. 

<hr/>

For example, this is how Tetris was written:

**Game Developer** I think I'm going to write a game.

**Friend** Oh, yeah? What will it be about?

**Game Developer** I don't know. I think I'll start with Pong, take away the ball, make the paddle fall from the sky, and have people stack all the paddles up.

**Friend** That sounds awesome!

<hr/>

Also, this is how Angry Birds came into being:

**Game Developer** I think I'm going to write a game.

**Friend** Oh, yeah? What will it be about?

**Game Developer** I don't know. I think I'll start with Pong, repurpose the ball so that you throw a red ball at a bunch of green balls, and I'll use a bunch of paddles to protect the green balls.

**Friend** That sounds awesome!

In fact, most people don't realize that Microsoft Windows was developed by Bill Gates in much the same way.

**Bill Gates** I think I'm going to write an operating system.

**Friend** Oh, yeah? What will it be about?

**Bill Gates** I don't know. I think I'll start with Pong, make the ball something people click around with, and I'll use the paddle at the bottom of the screen as a place for other paddles that tell people stuff.

**Friend** That sounds awesome!
