# Big Picture
What does it mean to study programming?

# "To Do"
* Read *Studying Programming*, chapters four and five
* Watch the YouTube Lecture (YTL) [Introducing Variables](http://icanhascheezburger.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/funny-pictures-you-will-take-me-to-jabba-now.jpg)

UPDATE: The [pencasts](../resources/resources.html) took the place of the (possible) YouTube lecture.

# The Plan

&nbsp; |&nbsp; | &nbsp;
 :-- | :--: | :--
 **Activity** | **Time** | **Description**
Quiz | 10 min | Prep quiz.
Q & A | 20 min | Q & A
Quaddie | 15 min | Quaddie discuss.
Summary | 10 min | Highlights
Sheet | 15 min | A... *worksheet*?
&nbsp;|&nbsp; |  &nbsp;

# Quiz
A short quiz over the material from *Studying Programming* and the YTL.

# Q & A 
We'll follow up the quiz with evaluation and a question and answer session regarding the material you prepped.

# Quaddie Discuss
Grab a second pair, and use these questions as a starting point for discussion of your reading in SP:

1. What stood out to you in your reading? Was there anything you thought was particularly interesting?
1. If you were going to transform your study habits to accommodate something you read in SP, what sounded like the easiest thing you could do?
1. Similarly, what sounded like the hardest thing you could do? Should you?
1. How could your partner and/or other members of our community help you tackle those challenges?

# Summary
It would be good to share some of the highlights of our small-group conversations back with the whole class. We'll take a few minutes to do so.

# Sheet
To wrap the day, we'll take fifteen minutes to do some work with our programming partner on paper. This paper work will help you identify the use of *variables* in code, and give the two of you a chance to talk about what some small pieces of code mean.

# Deliverable

Add the hand coding work to your lab notebook when you are done.
