# Big Picture
We'll introduce looping through some active... activities.

# "To Do"
No particular prep; you just finished the midterm.

# Do Stuff

*This was written after-the-fact...*

We did some activities surrounding sorting. I don't think it was the best way to introduce looping, and it's something to think about for future iterations. It wasn't bad... the theory was that you (intuitively) understand sorting, and it involves iteration. But, it seems like we could come up with something better as a topic introduction.

We'll file it under "things that make you go *hmm*."
