# Quiz
A short quiz over chapters one, two, and the pair programming video.

# Eval
We'll swap quizzes, and evaluate them. That way, we get instant gratification and learn from our mistakes.

# Lab Book
The lab book is an important part of your work in this class.

* When you make mistakes in your code, you should write down what was wrong, and how you fixed it.
* When you do something awesome, you should make note of how you did it.
* When you have an image or other output that you think is worth noting, save it by printing it into your notebook.

We'll take a few minutes to talk about lab books in this class and go through it with your partner.

# Hands On #1
Break into pairs and dive into our first lab.

# Discuss
We'll take a few minutes to catalog the challenges you've run into so far, as well as the solutions you came up with. This will give all of us a chance to learn from each-other's explorations.

# Break
Seventh inning stretch!

# Hands On #2
We'll continue our exploration of Processing.

# Show & Tell
Why do visual work if you can't share what you've done with others? We'll take some time to share our work and highlight the one or two things that surprised you most in doing it.

# Prof Yak #1
I'll talk about what we're doing Thursday.
