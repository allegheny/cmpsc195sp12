# About the Pencasts

Pencasts are made with a special pen and paper that record the path of the pen as well as what I say while writing. I try and keep them short. The nice thing is you can skip around in them as well as watch them more than once (if that helps). 

If you have particular questions you would like explained via a pencast, feel free to ask. It's like your own personal tutoring-question-answering-service. Except, actually, it's your prof. But, I guess that's the same thing.

All pencasts are made available under the same CC-BY-SA license as the rest of this site.
