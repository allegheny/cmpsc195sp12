# Tiny Bit o' Background

All of the computers in the Department of Computer Science at Allegheny College use Ubuntu Linux. This means it is free software (you can get a copy, legally), and it is probably different than what you've used elsewhere (but you'll do just fine).

# Log In

We told you your password in class. Use it to log in with your Allegheny username.

# "About Me"

Click on **System**, then **Preferences**, then **About Me**.

# Pick a new Password

It can be the same as your Allegheny password.

Or, if you want, you could pick a password that is actually safe. (It is likely that the password you chose could easily be hacked/broken by a computer program.)

XKCD is a web comic that explores the funny (and, often, human) side of computing and science geekery.
