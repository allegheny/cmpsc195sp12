The first two days have, I thought, been excellent. Both Prof. Roos thought it was **awesome** how you were ready to go today, dove in, and started in with Processing.

I don't know if you realize it, but by coming up with three, 10-line works of art, you've now written at least 30 lines of code in Java. I think this is especially great because you all had just finished talking about how nervous you were about this class.

I'm pretty sure you're all going to rock. Keep up the good energy.

### Reading

If you would be so kind as to read *Studying Programming*, chapter 4, for Thursday, that would be wonderful. (Please look in Sakai for this material, under *Resources*.) I know it is short notice. I really wanted to see how things went before getting too far ahead; we'll get the website built out further shortly.

### Pencasts

I've got three *pencasts* for you. They are intended to supplement the next readings. So, they're for next Tuesday, not tomorrow. (Each of the three is roughly 4 minutes long, so if you want to watch them now, feel free.)

On Thursday, we'll introduce our Q&A forum (Piazza), and I want to encourage you to feel free to request pencasts about specific topics. It can be a really nice way to answer questions, and at any point that you think one would be useful, please feel free to ask for one.

All of the pencasts (as well as other materials in the future) can be found in the [Resources](http://rockalypse.org/courses/cmpsc195sp12/resources/) section of the site.
