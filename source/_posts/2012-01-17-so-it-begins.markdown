Spring has roared in with... *rain*.

But we won't let that get us down! Not at all! This is *Meadville*, and we're *Gators*, and we **like this weather**!

*cough*

Dubious comments about the weather aside, welcome to our first offering of CMPSC 195: Media Computation. We expect it to be an exciting semester, and hope that you're prepared to set aside some of your fears about computing (more than one of you have expressed your concern), and that you're ready to discover, learn, and enjoy tackling new ideas and things that you didn't know you could do.
