Just a few quick reminders for all of you:

1. The [calendar]({{ site.url | append: "/calendar.html"}}) page provides an overview of everything we're doing this term.
1. This Tuesday we'll be working through [our first lab]({{ site.url | append: "/cal/week02-1.html"}}).

The lab page reminds you of your reading for Tuesday and provides a link to the lab itself. (You should read that before you come in.) 

I hope all is going well with your reading and exploration. Try installing Processing on your own computer, work your way through the first two chapters of *Learning Processing*, and we'll start Tuesday off with Q&A, as I imagine you will have many questions. (That, by-the-way, is the way we expect things to go.)
